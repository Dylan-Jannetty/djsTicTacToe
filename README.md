# The Story behind the project:
First starting off I felt overwhelmed and did not know where to even start. After writing out some user stories and frameworks it gave me a starting point. I tried to follow the suggested schedule to a tee so I had challenges to accomplish and figured it would give me smaller challenges to accomplish then tie together to accomplish the ultimate challenge of completing my tic tac toe game. I first created an empty gameboard in my game.js file with an empty array. I then made a function to rotate between players. I then made a function to not be able to add or replace a already occupied spot. Followed by a function with two if statements to check all possible wins for X and O to check for winner. Moving onto my authentications I created a Sign-up, sign-in, change-password, and sign up button in my HTML. Then linked them to api.js and my ui.js file. Moving onto Game UI I designed the board in HTML storing each spot in the board in its seperate div and numbered there data-cell with the position on the board. I made a click handler function for when a box is clicked on the board it checks for winner updates gameboard, and changes turn. Moving on to Game API I made a "POST" - for new game, "PATCH" - update game, a "GET" - for getting number of games played. I wanted do all styling at the end once I met all requirements. So I saved my CSS for last.

# Unsolved problems:
1. Being able to play from two different devices.
2. Being able to play vs computer.
3. Adding a timer for how long a message appears at the top of the screen.
4. Placing the New game button and get games button on the side of the board so you do not need to scroll down.
